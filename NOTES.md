RUNTIME COMPLEXITY:

we are comparing/deciding what solution/algorithm to any problem is 'better' than another.

our goal is to identify any given runtime complexity

look at the iterative solution of the reversestring problem: see screenshot:
for each additional character we add in the input, we have to do one more additional step of work: linear runtime (one to one relationship between of input elements into the algo, and the steps of work to process it)

on the other hand, look at the nested loops in the solution to the steps problem (see screenshot): N^2 runtime complexity or quadratic runtime.
